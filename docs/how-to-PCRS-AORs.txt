PCRS peakup is used for long staring observations with IRAC (e.g., exoplanet observations) in which high photometric precision (part in 103 or better) is required. PCRS peak-up tool provides enhanced accuracy (< 1000 parts per million) in positioning a target during staring mode observations. PCRS peak-up allows the positioning of a target to an accuracy of about 0.1 pixel, reducing the range of the pixel phase effect - intrapixel effect. 
This option should enable a more accurate placement of the target on the default central pixel (full array or subarray). 

It also provides the high precision maps of the intrapixel photometric variation in a region approximately 1/4 pixels on a side, centered on the intrapixel gain "sweet spots" (positions of maximum sensitivity) for the Channel 1 and Channel 2 subarray mode. These maps will enable intrapixel correction without using observations themselves.
The IRAC Instrument Support team is only characterizing the Channel 1 and Channel 2 Subarray sweet spots, so to use the available gain maps to correct your photometry, you should use the offsets given for FOV=Sub for your given readout mode (Full or Sub). To get the best results, you should use staring mode ("Mapping Mode" = No and "Dither Pattern" = No) 

This peak up feature takes 2-5 additional minutes of observing. 

conditions to use this mode:

1. The peak-up target must be in the magnitude range 7.0 mag < V < 12.5 mag.
2. There should be no neighbours within 40 arcseconds of the target that are brighter than the magnitude of the peak-up star + 5.5.

If your target is NOT between 7 and 12.5, you can stare at the nearby star. Use the "PCRS selection" button in Spot to choose a nearby star from the PCRS Guide Star Catalog, which contains a carefully selected subset of stars from the Tycho catalogue, or specify your own offset star. Both of the requiremnets above are automatically satisfied when choosing PCRS Guide Star Catalog.

If you are using an offset target, the recommendation is to choose the closest possible star to your science target. Make sure that the relative astrometric positions of your peak-up star and your science target are as precisely known as possible, as the efficacy of the peak-up using the guide star method depends directly on the knowledge of the angular offset between the guide star and the target. 


After peak-up, you can ensure that your target is placed in the "sweet spot" region by specifying your target as a Fixed Cluster target in Spot, with Array (Row,Col) offsets given in the table below.

PHASE CURVE OBSERVATIONS WITH PCRS peak-up
-------------------------------------------

PCRS peak-up has the ability to reposition a target onto the same spot on a pixel during a long stare, thus enhancing the precision of time-domain measurements. Typically, the Spitzer pointing system drifts systematically by approximately 0.35" per day. This means that in about 12 hours a target placed halfway between the center and the edge of the well-characterized 0.5-pixel "sweet spot" of the Channel 1 or Channel 2 subarray has a good chance of drifting out of the calibrated region. 

To eliminate this problem, we recommend breaking up all staring observations that are longer than 12 hrs into separate AORs lasting 12 hrs or less, all of which should have PCRS peak-up. 

The AORs should be identical copies of each other, with the exception being that the Number of Frames should be changed to make each AOR shorter than 12 hrs and obtain the total duration as desired. They should also be linked together using Chain constraints, to ensure that they are scheduled as a single unit. 

In addition to using the PCRS peak-up in long staring observations, we recommend inserting a 30 minute long separate AOR before the science AOR at the same target position and in staring mode with the same peak-up strategy and the same frame time. This will allow the spacecraft pointing to stabilize, removing a small drift observed in the first roughly 30 minutes of many long staring observations. By following the 30 minute AOR with the true science AOR(s) the spacecraft is re-pointed accurately via the peakup and sweet spot offset and this drift will not occur. The 30 minute extra non-science AOR should be tied with chain constraints to the science AOR(s).


An Example 40-hour Observation with PCRS Peak-up

For a 40-hour staring mode observation you need to specify in Spot:

1. One 30 min PCRS peak-up AOR with target on sweet spot
2. A 12-hour PCRS peak-up AOR with target on sweet spot
3. A second 12-hour PCRS peak-up AOR with target on sweet spot
4. A third 12-hour PCRS peak-up AOR with target on sweet spot
5. 4-hour PCRS peak-up AOR with target on sweet spot
6. Chain all the AORs together so that they will be observed back to back (you can safely ignore any warnings that Spot may give about a chain being longer than 24 hours)
 

SPOT instructions
--------------------

To use this option, go to the Menu/Observations/Post Cryo-Mapping. 

1. In peak-up settings choose PCRS Peak Up
2. If your star does not follow requirements press PCRS selection and select a star from the PCRS star catalogue
3. Click anywhere on the row to select the star



AOR instructions for the phase curves
--------------------------------------
1. make vis file in an usual way 
2. aai file has extra column PCRS  which has value -1, as default
manual - sets the pcrs option
off makes the aors in the usual way
-1 is the same as manual
 the only thing is different that it makes 30 minute

3. in aai file set the offset position for the "sweet spot"
 use off_row and off_col with the values given on this link

4. tep is the same as usual

5. you specify duration of the total phase curve observation, as 1.25 * period  + hour, which includes first 30 minutes of the stabilization period aor
6. change event to transit
7. you run auto aor in the usual way
8. from auto_aor delete all times after 1 May 2014
9. go to spot and see if total duration is calculated tool/calculate all estimates, then separate wanted duration to chains, including 30 minutes staring at the beginning
10. if not, find the number of frames which gives the total duration of 12 hours
11. and change the AOR_LABEL: to -1a at the end of the label
12. copy everything from AOT_TYOE to SPECIAL: IMPACT = none and add another 12 hour frames
13. change the name of the AOR LABEL again to: -1b
14. then do it again, copy the same section, specify 12 hour duration, or what ever you are left with (frames, times) and change the name -1c
15. do not change anything in CO section
16. bottom section we should change part AORS:AOR1 stays the same
                                              AOR2 = ...-1a
                                              AOR3 =    -1b
                                              ...
                                              AOR# =    -co

then go to SPOT:
1. calculate all estimates
2. check manually if duration is good
3. if your science target is offered use it as your PCRS target otherwise use the top star on the catalogue list because that is the star which is the closest to your target star
4. set PCRS with the target for all AORS except CO
5. when setting PCRS for your science target, use offset button, and leave the offsets as 0.0 for RA and Dec. and fill in its V magnitude. The observation will use the RA/Dec and proper motion values specified in your target specification.
6. sometimes you may want to select your own target, you should click on the "Position" radio button, and then fill in the Name, Ra/Dec and proper motions and epoch. Please make sure again that the star fulfils the criteria
5 recalculate estimates
6. do usual checking procedure



secondary eclipse observations
---------------------------------
new duration for the observations is:
half hour to stabilize + PCRS (4-5 mins) + half hour + max(2 hours, of ecldur/2) + eclipsedur + max(2 hours, ecldur/2)
