The following is an explanation of how horizons_Sun-2013-08-07.vec was created.
You can follow the same procedure to create a similar file for any
other data set.  

In order to create horizons_Sun-2013-08-07.vec or a similar file:
1. Go to the horizons webpage: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons
2. You will see that the HORIZONS system can be accessed using any of the following methods: 
 telnet  
 email
 web-interface
Chose web-interface. 
3. You will see the default settings: 

Current Settings
Ephemeris Type [change] :  OBSERVER 
Target Body [change] :  Mars [499] 
Observer Location [change] :  Geocentric [500] 
Time Span [change] :  Start=2007-03-19, Stop=2007-04-18, Step=1 d 
Table Settings [change] :  defaults 
Display/Output [change] :  default (formatted HTML) 

(Note: Time span will change to reflect current date)

You want to change the settings so that they look like this (for 2013-08-07 times are as stated, for other observations change the times accordingly):


Current Settings
Ephemeris Type [change] :  VECTORS 
Target Body [change] :  Solar System Barycenter [SSB] [0]
Coordinate Origin [change] :  Mauna Kea [568] ( 204째31'40.1''E, 19째49'34.0''N, 4212.4 m )
Time Span [change] :  Start=2013-08-07 05:00, Stop=2013-08-07 16:00, Step=10 m
Table Settings [change] :  output units=KM-S; reference plane=FRAME; labels=YES
Display/Output [change] :  download/save (plain text file) 


Do this by: 
a) Changing the ephemeris type settings.  
Your choices are:  
- Observer Table (Use this table type to generate a table of observer quantities (such as R.A./Dec.) for any object with respect to a geocentric or topocentric observer. )
 - Vector Table (Use this table type to generate a Cartesian state vector table of any object with respect to any major body. )
 - Orbital Elements (Use this table type to generate a table of osculating orbital elements for any object with respect to an appropriate major body.)
CHOOSE Vector Table
b) Changing the Taget Body settings.  
You will be given a search box, type in "0" and search either all bodies or major bodies, it should come up with "Solar System Barycenter [SSB] [0]" 
c)Changing the Coordinate Origin.
in the 'Lookup Named Location' search box, type "Mauna Kea", "Las Campanas", "Cerro Pachon", or some other location 
This should give you "Mauna Kea [568] ( 204째31'40.1''E, 19째49'34.0''N, 4212.4 m )"
d) change the Time Span Settings
These data were acquired on 2013-08-07 centered around 11:00 UT, so I chose to get horizons data for the entire night (you need at least a 3-4 hours on either side) in 10 minute intervals.
e) Changing the Table Settings.
-change the output units to "km & km/s"
-change the reference plane to "Earth mean equator and equinox of reference epoch
-find labels : (box)  -- enable labeling of each vector component, and check the box
-find object page : (box)  -- include object information/data page on output, the box should be checked by default , but if not checked, check it.        
f) Display/Output settings.
Either change to download/save (in which case it will prompt you name the file when you go to "Generate Ephemeris") 
Or leave as is and copy and paste the information from the browser. 

When all the settings have been properly changed Press the "Generate Ephemeris" button.  


*** Update 6/3/07:
Formerly we used the setting
Coordinate Origin [change] :  Sun (body center) [500@10]
