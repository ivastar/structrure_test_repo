OUTLINE OF THE AOR MAKING PROCESS:
----------------------------------

Two programs:
Spot & Leopard
Spot targets Spitzer
Leopard downloads data

Locations:
/home/esp01/code/bin
spot (to run spot, leopard)

TEP files (Transiting Extrasolar Planets):
 - contain all the data about any planet

TEP Location:
/home/esp01/runs/seclsn/data

Information for TEP files:
http://exoplanet.eu/

TO MAKE AN AOR:
use auto_aor

auto_aor Location:
/home/esp01/runs/planetephem/auto_aor
README file: README_auto_aor

Planet directory:
/home/esp01/runs/planetephem

If we are making an aor for planet FAKEPLAN:
cd /home/esp01/runs/planetephem

mkdir FAKEPLAN
cd FAKEPLAN

SAVE ALL AORS IN THIS DIRECTORY

Naming format for AORS:
<planetname>-<event>-ch<channels>-<shot number>-<revision number><username>.aor

event can either be ecl, tran, orb
channel number = wavelength (doc: /home/esp01/doc/spitzer_obs_planning)
shot number: time we are shooting it (1st, 2nd, etc)
revision number: every time you make a change, update the number

EXAMPLE:
hd209458b-ecl-ch24-3-1ccampo.aor

TO MAKE AN AOR, USE AUTO_AOR:
It requires 3 files to use:

AAI FILE (auto_aor info):
Location: /home/esp01/obsprep/aorpars
OLD LOCATION: /home/esp01/runs/aor_input
README: /home/esp01/runs/aor_input/README
        /home/esp01/doc/README_aai

A lot of info for .aai files is in the doc:
/home/esp01/doc/spitzer_obs_planning

VIS FILE (visibility):
Loc: /home/esp01/obsprep/visibility

These are created IN SPOT
Readme: /home/esp01/obsprep/visibility/README_vis
	/home/esp01/doc/README_vis

Third file is the tep file.

To use auto_aor, we need the AAI, VIS, and TEP files

cd /home/esp01/runs/planetephem/<planet dir>

/home/esp01/runs/planetephem/auto_aor/auto_aor 

EXAMPLE:
/location of auto_aor/auto_aor /loc of tep/fake.tep /loc/fake.aai /loc/fake.vis

After AOR is created, open it up in spot!

IN SPOT: tools > recompute all estimates > all aors

DURATION SHOULD ALWAYS BE CLOSE TO 2 * ECLDUR

images > DSS images 
 click bubble 'The best of a combined list of plates'
 OK

overlays > AORs on images...

Observation date will be a predicted date IN THE FUTURE
 NOT PAST!!!

If we need to change the coordinates, find a position in SPOT
by moving the cursor and finding the RA and DEC of a dark
area.  Record these coordinates and change by the following
method:

open .aai file
 change the co_ra and co_dec to your coordiantes
 save as NEW file with incremented serial number!

Once edited, run auto_aor again with new file

Check new AOR in spot and make sure everything is correct

IF YOU HAVE A GOOD, FINAL AOR:
save it from spot with the name -
 <planetname>-<event>-ch<channels>-<shot number>-<revision number><username>.aor


SECLSN INFORMATION:
-------------------

Calculates the signal to noise ratio for given planets
