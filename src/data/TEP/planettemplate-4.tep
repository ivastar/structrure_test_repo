# Name the file: planetname-yyyy-mm-dd-nn.tep
# nn is a serial number and may also include an apended comment (no
# dashes), as in -01circ, -02ecc, etc.
# Please be precise about capitalization, etc.: WASP-12b-2008-02-23-02.tep
# NOT wasp12b_2008-02-23-02.tep, or files will list out of order.

# Several computer program will read this, so it is important to
# follow the value format, especially no spaces in strings and include
# placeholder dash for empty column.

# Several humans will read this, so it is important to keep the
# columns lined up, etc.

# Put longer comments at the bottom, above this instruction section.

# If your model is producing the results, for concepts that have more
# than one set of variables (e.g., e/omega or eclphase;
# Rp/RpRs/RpRssq), quote all that are directly fit by your model.
# It's ok to give ones that are calculated from fit values, as well.

# Reference examples (no spaces!):
# starpet
# WASP_FIT
# HAT_FIT
# SIMBAD
# Street2010arXiv:1234.567890
# Hellier2009ApJ712:34

# If values from papers, set units in their column.  Don't convert values. 
# If values from your model, use our default units if possible.
# If value is assumed, set uncertainty to 0.
# If uncertainty exists but is not known, leave as -1.

# Don't touch column 1.  Use spaces, not tabs.
# Fill in columns 2, 3, 4, 5: 'S' items needed for S/N calc, 'A' needed for AOR.
# Replace blanks with underscores, not dashes, in string values.
# Everything after a "#" is a comment.
# Put -1 (-91 for dec) if you don't know or don't want to say just yet.
