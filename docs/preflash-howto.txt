In general (please put this in a preflash document in the doc directory):

The photometry aperture should be at the average location in the
dataset, and it should be the same size.  If you can find a meaningful
sky annulus, use that, but if the source is so extended that it fills
the screen, use just the raw aperture value and no sky and see what
that looks like.  Or, use a smooth, low-signal region anywhere on the
chip.  The latter will at least remove the instrumental background.
